üí≠ IMAGINE you could see the first-hand effects of climate change in Fiji without a passport or releasing detrimental fossil fuels all for FREE. Or, dance with Native African tribes and learn about their culture all within the comfort of your own home? All you need is a piece of cardboard, your cell phone, and us to guide you. 

üëã Welcome to SPECTR STUDIOS, where immersive technology/virtual reality (VR) meets social impact. We're a group of teenagers aiming to catalyze positive change. Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to harness the transformative potential of virtual reality to address pressing global issues. From mental health and climate action to cultural preservation and the support of marginalized voices, our mission is to inspire change by bringing stories to life in ways that touch hearts and minds. 

üì¶ We will open-source our VR cardboard design, which allows the user to design their own VR headset and use their cell phone to display the content anywhere and everywhere. By harnessing VR, stories can be experienced across the world without the need to harm Mother Earth with traveling and can be accessible to those who do not have full physical mobility.
