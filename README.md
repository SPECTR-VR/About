Welcome to SPECTR VR, where immersive technology/virtual reality (VR) meets social impact. Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to harness the transformative potential of virtual reality to address pressing global issues. From mental health and climate action to cultural preservation and the support of marginalized voices, our mission is to inspire change by bringing stories to life in ways that touch hearts and minds. 

We will open-source our VR cardboard design, which allows the user to design their own VR headset and use their cell phone to display the content anywhere and everywhere. By harnessing VR, stories can be experienced across the world without the need to harm Mother Earth with traveling and can be accessible to those who do not have full physical mobility.

At SPECTR VR, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to see the world differently and to be moved by stories that matter. Our legacy is one of innovation, inclusivity, and unwavering commitment to making the world a better place, one immersive experience at a time. Join us as we continue to explore new frontiers in visual storytelling and create a lasting impact on the world.

We're covering these issues with more to come:

[FOUNDER'S MESSAGE: I've always been an interdisciplinary individual looking for ways to combine my passion for tech with the arts. I was first immersed in the world of visual storytelling through documentaries (Seaspiracy, What the Health, etc.) when I realized the injustices whistleblowers were facing just for their courage on speaking up. The films had moved me so much to the point I began advocating for whistleblowers. I know many people, globally, also have been impacted by the power of storytelling. That's when I stumbled across a VR-formatted spoken word short film featuring an indigenous tribe and their culture, and it made me tear up. That's when I realized how important it was to harness the power of visual storytelling to educate the globe on pressing societal issues. I hope, together, through accessible and immersive visual storytelling, we can write the stories of tomorrow.]
