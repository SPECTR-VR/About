Learn all about SPECTR VR: our origin, our mission, and our legacy


Welcome to SPECTR VR, where immersive technology/virtual reality (VR) meets social impact. Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to harness the transformative potential of virtual reality to address pressing global issues. From mental health and climate action to cultural preservation and the support of marginalized voices, our mission is to inspire change by bringing stories to life in ways that touch hearts and minds. 

We will open-source our VR cardboard design, which allows the user to design their own VR headset and use their cell phone to display the content. By harnessing VR, stories can be experienced across the world without the need to harm our Mother Earth with traveling.

At SPECTR VR, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to see the world differently and to be moved by stories that matter. Our legacy is one of innovation, inclusivity, and unwavering commitment to making the world a better place, one immersive experience at a time. Join us as we continue to explore new frontiers in visual storytelling and create a lasting impact on the world.
